# EmailGist Training Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive training pipeline for EmailGist that addresses your requirements for training both BART for summarization and spaCy for entity recognition on business email data. The implementation follows the exact plan you provided and includes all the necessary components.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing (`utils/preprocessing.py` & `training/data_prep.py`)

**Features:**

- Metadata extraction (length, word count, meeting indicators, etc.)
- Dataset splitting (train/validation/test)
- Integration with Enron email dataset via Kaggle

**Key Functions:**
- `clean_email_text()`: Comprehensive email cleaning
- `extract_email_metadata()`: Extract email characteristics
- `preprocess_email_dataset()`: Full dataset preprocessing
- `split_dataset()`: Proper data splitting

### 2. BART Summarization Training (`training/bart_trainer.py`)

**Features:**
- **Synthetic Summary Generation**: Uses pre-trained BART to generate initial summaries
- **Fine-tuning Pipeline**: Customizes BART for email-specific summarization

### 5. Main Training Pipeline (`training/train_models.py`)

**Features:**
- **Orchestrated Training**: Coordinates all components
- **Configurable Parameters**: Customizable training settings
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive logging and progress reporting
- **Command-line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with arguments

**Key Features:**

## Implementation Details

### Synthetic Data Generation Strategy

**BART Summarization:**
1. Uses pre-trained `facebook/bart-large-cnn` to generate initial summaries
2. Treats generated summaries as ground truth for fine-tuning
3. Allows the model to learn email-specific summarization patterns

**spaCy Entity Recognition:**
1. Uses rule-based patterns to identify entities in emails
2. Focuses on business-relevant entities (PERSON, ORG, DATE, TIME, EMAIL, etc.)
3. Provides sufficient training data for NER model learning

### Training Configuration

**BART Parameters:**
- Learning rate: 2e-5
- Batch size: 4 (adjustable based on GPU memory)
- Max input length: 1024 tokens
- Max target length: 150 tokens
- Early stopping with patience: 3 epochs

**spaCy Parameters:**
- Training iterations: 10
- Dropout: 0.5
- Batch size: 4
- Entity labels: 11 business-relevant types

### Entity Types Supported

1. **PERSON**: Person names
2. **ORG**: Organization/company names
3. **DATE**: Dates and time periods
4. **TIME**: Specific times
5. **EMAIL**: Email addresses
6. **PHONE**: Phone numbers
7. **ADDRESS**: Physical addresses
8. **PRODUCT**: Products and services
9. **AMOUNT**: Monetary amounts
10. **MEETING**: Meeting-related terms
11. **DEADLINE**: Deadline and urgency terms

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment:**
```bash
cd backend/training
python setup_training.py
```

2. **Run Complete Pipeline:**
```bash

```

3. **Custom Training:**
```bash
python train_models.py \
    --output-dir ./my_output \
    --bart-epochs 5 \
    --spacy-iterations 15
```
