# EmailGist üìß‚ú®

## Problem Statement

**The Problem**: Professionals are overwhelmed by lengthy emails containing critical information buried in verbose text. Long-form business communications, client updates, and project threads lead to missed deadlines, overlooked action items, and decision paralysis as people struggle to quickly identify what's important.

**The Solution**: EmailGist transforms lengthy emails into actionable insights using AI-powered summarization and intelligent highlighting.

**Target Users**: 
- Busy executives and managers dealing with email overload
- Project coordinators tracking multiple client communications
- Sales professionals managing prospect conversations
- Anyone who regularly receives lengthy, information-dense emails

## Why I'm Building This

I'm proving that **modern NLP can make email management effortless without sacrificing important context**. This project demonstrates:

- **Technical Mastery**: Full-stack AI application with production-ready deployment
- **Real Value Creation**: Solving a genuine productivity pain point experienced by millions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Building systems that can handle enterprise-level email volumes
- **User-Centric Design**: Creating intuitive interfaces that encourage daily adoption

This isn't just another summarization tool‚Äîit's a productivity multiplier that gives time back to professionals.

## Features

* **Summarization API**: `/summarize` endpoint that generates brief, useful summaries of email text
* **Highlight Extraction**: Returns dummy highlights (soon powered by spaCy)
* **Health Check Endpoint**: Quickly verify server status and uptime
* **FastAPI Docs**: Auto-generated Swagger UI for easy API testing

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** - Modern UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling

### Backend

* **FastAPI** ‚Äì Async Python web framework
* **Python 3.11** ‚Äì Primary language/runtime
* **Uvicorn** ‚Äì ASGI server for running the app

### NLP Tools (Planned/Stubbed)

* **HuggingFace Transformers** ‚Äì Summarization (coming soon)
* **spaCy** ‚Äì NER for highlights (next phase)
* **Regex** ‚Äì Lightweight entity matching

## How to Use It (Backend Only)

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emailgist.git

## My Commitment

I'm building EmailGist to:

* ‚úÖ Show that backend-focused projects can create real value
* ‚úÖ Sharpen my skills in full-stack AI engineering
* ‚úÖ Launch fast, iterate fast, and deliver utility from day one

Even without a frontend, the API is working‚Äîand that‚Äôs already saving time.
